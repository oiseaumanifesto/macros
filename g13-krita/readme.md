### G-13 Keymap for Krita

This mapping uses no custom shortcuts for Krita, so it will work as intended with the default keymapping. Just import into your Logitech G software while your G-13 is plugged in. Feel free to edit or translate into another keymapping/macro program.

Uses only the first profile (M1). No buttons on the joystick cluster are used.
