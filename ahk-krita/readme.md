### One Handed AHK Scripts for Krita
AHK scripts for a onehanded keyboard. The configurations for some of these functions are arbitrary and only work ebcause I've made them a real shortcut in Krita. You'll need to import or add the shortcuts manually to make the script work correctly:

* New Layer: Ctrl+Insert
* Reset Canvas Rotation: Alt+0

Choose from using volume mute (great for if you have an external media knob) or shift+space as the suspension toggle. The script launches in suspension by default.
