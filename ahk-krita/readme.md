### One Handed AHK Scripts for Krita
AHK scripts for a onehanded keyboard. The configurations for some of these functions are arbitrary and only work ebcause I've made them a real shortcut in Krita. You'll need to import my krita shortcuts file, add the shortcuts into krita yourself, or reprogram the scripts to your own shortcuts for all functions to work properly.

Arbitrary shortcuts are:
* New Layer: Ctrl+Insert
* Reset Canvas Rotation: Alt+0

Choose from using volume mute (great for if you have an external media knob) or shift+space as the suspension toggle. The script launches in suspension by default. Feel free to use and edit.
